# CoffeeMachine
A simple program that imitates the operation of a coffee machine.
The user can choose from a few simple options, such as:
- buying coffee (within this project, we have a choice of 3 types of coffee for the purpose of checking the correctness of the program),
- refilling ingredients and cups, 
- displaying the current state of ingredients,
- withdrawing cash. 

The program, like the real machine, monitors the amount of ingredients and if the amount of one of them is not enough to make the selected type of coffee, 
it will display a message about the lack of it.
The "coffee machine" runs until the user decides to turn it off.
